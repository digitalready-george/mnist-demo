# mnist-demo
A demo of training a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

This code is based off Michael Nielsen's free book, "Neural Networks and Deep Learning".
Support his work here: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html

To experiment with neural networks, change the network and training parameters in `demo.py`.

Run `demo.py` in a Python IDE to see the training results outputted to the console.
